"""The SAFE PNS prediction of a whole sequence: the summary (the peak, its time and the
peak of each axis), the intervals at or above the stimulation limit, and the level.

The level is the minimum and the maximum of the PNS total in fixed time bins. It is for a
caller that draws the PNS of a long sequence (pulseq-reports, for example) and cannot keep
one value for each sample. The checks of this package use the summary and the intervals,
not the level.

`pns_levels` samples the gradients block by block (`GradientSampler.block_samples`),
runs the SAFE model of the pinned pypulseq fork over them in chunks
(`_safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk`, which carries the filter state from one chunk to the next),
and keeps only the level, the summary and the intervals. Its memory does not grow with
the duration of the sequence, except for the level (at most `MAX_BINS` bins) and the
intervals.

The samples of each block start at the start of that block, not at a time summed over the
earlier blocks. Thus a block gives the same samples wherever it is in the sequence, and
a drawing tool that samples one block with the same rule gets the same values.

The module also has the SAFE model of the target profile (`SAFE_MODEL`, for
`[models.pns.safe]`) and `hw_from_dict`, which makes the hardware argument of
`pns_levels` from the parameters of that model.

    hardware when both are None (`asc.read_gradient_asc`, `asc.hardware_name` and
    `asc.EXAMPLE_HARDWARE` choose the name and the file of the first and the last).

    `hardware` is a pair `(struct, label)`: `struct` is a SAFE hardware struct in the form
    of pypulseq's `asc_to_hw` (a `SimpleNamespace` with `.x`, `.y` and `.z`, each with
    `tau1` to `tau3`, `a1` to `a3`, `stim_limit`, `stim_thresh` and `g_scale`), and `label`
    is the string that `PnsLevels.hardware` gives. `PnsLevels.asc_file` is then None.
    `gradient_asc` and `hardware` together raise ValueError.

    The model is `calc_pns` of the pinned fork, on other samples:

    1. `dt = seq.grad_raster_time`. The samples are `GradientSampler.block_samples` of
       each axis (Hz/m), divided by `seq.system.gamma` (T/m), as `calc_pns` divides.
       When a block is not on the raster (`on_raster` False), the samples are
       `GradientSampler.sample` at the file times `(k + 0.5) * dt`, as `calc_pns`
       samples, with `k = 0 .. ceil((end - 1e-10) / dt) - 1` and `end` the end of the
       last block (`calc_pns` stops at the last gradient point instead; the samples
       after it are the decay of the filters).
    2. The samples go through `_safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk` in chunks of
       `bin_samples * ceil(CHUNK_SAMPLES / bin_samples)` samples (the whole number of
       bins nearest at or above `CHUNK_SAMPLES`), with `state=None` for the first chunk
       and the returned state after.
    3. The axis values are `0.01 *` the returned percent, and the total of a sample is
       `sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)` of them, with the numpy operations of `calc_pns`
       (`np.sqrt((comp ** 2).sum(axis=1))`).
    4. The level: the minimum and the maximum of the total in each bin of
       `bin_samples_for(num_samples, dt)` samples (the last bin can be shorter), cast
       to float32 outward: the minimum rounds down and the maximum rounds up
       (`numpy.nextafter` when the cast value is on the wrong side), so that each
       stored bin holds every total of its samples.
    5. The summary: the peak (float64), the axis peaks, and the peak time: the time
       `(k + 0.5) * dt` of the first sample whose total is at or above
       `peak * (1 - PEAK_TOLERANCE)`, as `PnsPrediction.peak_time_s`. The peak is
       known only at the end, so `pns_levels` keeps the start state of each chunk
       (12 numbers) and the float64 maximum of each chunk, and runs again only the
       first chunk whose maximum reaches the threshold.
    6. The intervals (`above_limit`): the runs of consecutive samples whose float64
       total is at or above `PNS_LIMIT`, found in the same loop as the peak (no second
       pass). A run that reaches the end of a chunk continues in the next chunk when
       the first sample of that chunk is also at or above `PNS_LIMIT`: it is one
       interval. An interval keeps its first and last sample, its largest total and the
       first sample with it. They use the totals of item 3, not the float32 bins, so
       `above_limit` is not empty if and only if `peak >= PNS_LIMIT`.

    The result does not depend on the chunk size (exact equality). A sequence without
    a gradient event gives `reason=NO_GRADIENTS`, no bins, peak 0, `peak_time_s` None
    and no interval. Memory: the chunk, the longest block, the stored level and a few
    numbers for each chunk and for each interval.
