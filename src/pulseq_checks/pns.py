"""Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) prediction for a Pulseq sequence with the SAFE model.

`pns_prediction` gives the PNS summary (the peak, the peak time and the axis peaks) of a
sequence: the reason, hardware and asc-file fields, and the summary fields of
`pns_levels.pns_levels`, cached one time for each (sequence object, gradient .asc file) by
`pns_levels_for`. `pns_levels_for` is the one place that runs the SAFE model
(`pns_levels.pns_levels`, which uses the pinned pypulseq fork's chunk function), so a
caller that needs both the summary and the level of one sequence (a report that shows the
PNS peak and draws the PNS over time, for example) runs the model one time.

The model needs the scanner's gradient hardware parameters, which Siemens keeps in the
gradient system's .asc file (MP_GPA_*.asc, or MP_GradSys_*.asc on newer software). The
files are confidential, so this library does not include any. Without them, the
prediction uses pypulseq's example hardware, which is not a real scanner.
