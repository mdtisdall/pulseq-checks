# Tests

This file describes each check that CI runs. CI runs `scripts/check` in the
`ci` Nix devShell on every pull request and on every push to `main`. The `ci`
devShell has only the tools that `scripts/check` uses. Run the same checks
locally with:

```bash
nix develop --command scripts/check
```

Each check below has:

- **Checks:** one statement of what the check makes sure of.
- **How:** the logic of the check, in words.
- **Assumptions:** what the check takes as true without testing it, and what
  it does not cover. A check can pass while one of its assumptions is false.

When you add, remove or change a test, update this file in the same pull
request. CI fails when a test has no entry here (see
[TESTS.md coverage](#testsmd-coverage)).

Terms used below:

- **Synthetic sequences** are the small sequences in `tests/synthetic.py`,
  built with pypulseq only. They use the system limits 28 mT/m and
  150 T/m/s, RF dead time 100 µs, RF ringdown 20 µs and ADC dead time 10 µs.

Contents:

1. [Static checks](#1-static-checks)
2. [Tests](#2-tests): the package; the shared sequence helpers, the sequence
   index, the raster sampler and the sequence extensions; the analyses (PNS and
   the PNS levels, and the gradient limits)

---

## 1. Static checks

### Dependency install

**Checks:** The locked dependencies install.

**How:** uv installs the project and its dependencies at the exact versions in
`uv.lock`, into the project environment. Every later step uses this
environment.

**Assumptions:**

- The install uses `--frozen`, which reads `uv.lock` and does not compare it to
  `pyproject.toml`. CI does not fail when `pyproject.toml` has a dependency
  change that is not in `uv.lock`.
- The Python version is the one from the Nix devShell (3.12). No other version
  is tested.

### Lint

**Checks:** The Python code has no findings from the rules that ruff turns on
by default.

**How:** ruff checks every Python file in the repository. The project sets
only the line length (100), so ruff uses its default rule set. `uv.lock` has
ruff 0.16.9.

**Assumptions:**

- The rule set is ruff's default, not a choice that the project makes. The
  project does not pin ruff in `pyproject.toml`, so an update of ruff in
  `uv.lock` can add or remove rules.
- Some common rules are not in the default set, so ruff does not report them:
  line length (E501), function complexity (C901), `print` calls (T201),
  `assert` statements (S101), too many arguments (PLR0913) and magic numbers
  (PLR2004). The format check wraps most long lines of code, but it does not
  split long strings or comments, so a line can still be longer than 100.
- ruff does not check types. No type checker runs in CI.

### Format

**Checks:** The Python code is formatted as ruff format would format it.

**How:** ruff format runs in check mode. It fails when any file would change.
The line length is 100.

**Assumptions:** None.

### Shell scripts

**Checks:** The shell scripts have no shellcheck warnings or errors.

**How:** shellcheck runs on `scripts/check` and the hook
`.claude/hooks/block-main-writes.sh`, at severity warning and above.

**Assumptions:**

- Only these two files are checked. A new shell script is not checked until
  it is added to the list in `scripts/check`.
- Info and style findings do not fail the check.

### TESTS.md coverage

**Checks:** TESTS.md has exactly one entry for each test that pytest collects,
in the section of that test's file, and no entry for a test that does not
exist.

**How:** In `scripts/check`, the pytest run writes the ID of each test that
it collects to a temporary file (option `--collected-tests-file`, from
`tests/conftest.py`), and the check reads that file (option `--collected`).
When the check runs alone, without `--collected`, it runs
`pytest --collect-only`, which lists the tests without running them. Each
pytest test is identified by its file name and its function name. A
parametrized test is one test. The check also reads each file that matches
`tests/js/test_*.js` as a file of JavaScript tests. This repository has no
JavaScript tests, so the check finds none. The check reads TESTS.md and takes
each level-4 heading that is a test name in backticks as an entry. The entry
belongs to the test file named in the nearest level-3 heading above it. The
check then reports:

- each pytest test with no entry in its file's section;
- each entry for a test that does not exist in that file;
- each test with more than one entry;
- each entry that is not under a test file's heading.

It fails if it reports anything, if pytest cannot collect the tests, or if it
cannot read the file of test IDs.

**Assumptions:**

- In `scripts/check`, the check runs after pytest, although this file lists
  it before the tests. When a test fails, `scripts/check` stops, and the
  check does not run.
- In `scripts/check`, pytest runs on the `tests` directory without other
  test selection (no `-k`), so the file of test IDs lists every test.
- Test files are identified by file name only, without the directory. The
  check fails if two test files have the same name.
- The check looks only at the headings. It does not check that an entry has
  its Checks, How and Assumptions parts, or that the text is still correct
  after a test changes.
- A level-4 heading that is not a test name in backticks (for example a
  description of shared test sequences) is not an entry and is ignored.

## 2. Tests

### 2.0 The package (`test_package.py`)

`test_package.py` tests that the package installs and imports, and that the
installed package has the version that `pyproject.toml` gives.

#### `test_the_package_imports_and_has_the_version_of_pyproject`

**Checks:** The package `pulseq_checks` imports from `src/pulseq_checks` of
this repository, and the installed distribution `pulseq-checks` has the
version that `pyproject.toml` gives in `[project]`.

**How:** The test imports `pulseq_checks` and compares the directory of the
imported package with `src/pulseq_checks` of the repository root. It reads `pyproject.toml` from the
repository root with `tomllib` and takes the value of `[project] version`. It
asks `importlib.metadata` for the version of the distribution `pulseq-checks`
and compares the two versions.

**Assumptions:**

- The metadata of the distribution `pulseq-checks` is the metadata of the
  editable install that `uv sync` makes. The test does not check where the
  metadata comes from.
- The version in the installed metadata is the version from the time of the
  last `uv sync`. After a change to the version in `pyproject.toml`, the test
  fails until `uv sync` runs again.

### 2.1 Shared sequence helpers (`test_seq_utils.py`)

`test_seq_utils.py` tests the shared helpers in `seq_utils.py` that the
report cards use to read a pypulseq sequence: the RF resampling helper and
the gradient corner/sample helper. It also checks that the synthetic
sequences in `tests/synthetic.py` are legal Pulseq.

#### `test_gamma_and_time_tolerance`

**Checks:** The gyromagnetic ratio is 42.576 MHz/T and the time tolerance is
1 ns.

**How:** The test compares the two shared constants with these values.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_hold_samples_keeps_uniform_shapes_unchanged`

**Checks:** An RF shape with uniform samples that fill the pulse duration is
used as it is.

**How:** The test makes a 3 ms sinc pulse. It checks that the sample times
are uniform and that the number of samples times the step is the pulse
duration. It then gets the held samples, and checks that the sample time and
the sample values are the same as the pulse's own.

**Assumptions:**

- pypulseq's sinc pulse has uniform samples that fill its duration. The test
  checks that before it tests the helper.

#### `test_hold_samples_interpolates_a_block_pulse`

**Checks:** A block pulse, which has samples only at its start and end, is
resampled on the RF raster with the correct number of samples, the correct
duration, and the correct flip angle.

**How:** The test makes a 2 ms, 60° block pulse. It checks that the pulse has
only two samples, which do not fill the duration. It gets the held samples on
the RF raster, and checks that the number of samples is the duration divided
by the raster, that the samples fill the duration, and that the sum of the
samples times the sample time is 60° as a fraction of a cycle (1/6).

**Assumptions:**

- The flip angle in cycles is the sum of B1 (Hz) × dt, which is correct for a
  pulse with constant phase.

#### `test_gradient_offsets_trapezoid`

**Checks:** `gradient_offsets` gives the delay and the four corner offsets and
amplitudes of a trapezoid gradient, with the offsets relative to the delay
(not including it).

**How:** The test makes an x trapezoid and calls `gradient_offsets`. It
compares the returned delay with the gradient's own `delay`, the returned
offsets with the running sum of the rise time, the flat time and the fall
time (starting at zero), and the returned amplitudes with zero, the plateau
amplitude twice, and zero.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_gradient_offsets_arbitrary`

**Checks:** `gradient_offsets` gives the delay and the sample offsets and
amplitudes of an arbitrary gradient, with one added point at each end, at
offset 0.0 and at the shape duration, for the shape's `first` and `last`
values.

**How:** The test makes an x arbitrary gradient from a 10-point waveform and
calls `gradient_offsets`. It checks
that the first and last returned amplitudes are the gradient's `first` and
`last` values, and that the first and last returned offsets are 0.0 and the
shape duration. It checks that the interior offsets and amplitudes are the
gradient's own sample times (`g.tt`) and waveform, unchanged.

**Assumptions:**

- pypulseq's `make_arbitrary_grad` gives the shape both `first` and
  `shape_dur` by default. The test checks that before it tests the helper,
  so the case without them (used only for a shape that already has points at
  its own ends) is not covered here.

#### `test_gradient_points_matches_gradient_offsets_exactly`

**Checks:** `gradient_points(g, t0)` gives exactly `(t0 + delay) + offsets`
for the `delay` and `offsets` that `gradient_offsets(g)` returns, for both a
trapezoid and an arbitrary gradient. This is the relationship a later phase
depends on to rebuild point times from the stored offset tables.

**How:** The test is parametrized over a trapezoid and an arbitrary
gradient. For each, it calls `gradient_points` with a non-zero `t0` and
`gradient_offsets` on the same event, then compares the two with
`numpy.testing.assert_array_equal` — exact equality, not a tolerance.

**Assumptions:**

- Bit-for-bit equality is the right check here, not an approximation: the
  point in this test is that `gradient_points` is defined in terms of
  `gradient_offsets` with no room for a rounding difference to creep in.

#### `test_gradient_points_trapezoid`

**Checks:** `gradient_points` gives the four corner times and amplitudes of a
trapezoid gradient.

**How:** The test makes an x trapezoid and calls `gradient_points` with a
start time `t0`. It compares the returned times with `t0` plus the
gradient's delay plus the running sum of the rise time, the flat time and
the fall time, and compares the returned amplitudes with zero, the plateau
amplitude twice, and zero.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_gradient_points_arbitrary`

**Checks:** `gradient_points` gives the sample times and amplitudes of an
arbitrary gradient, with one added point at each end for the shape's first
and last values.

**How:** The test makes an x arbitrary gradient from a 10-point waveform and
calls `gradient_points` with a start time `t0`. It checks that the first and
last returned amplitudes are the gradient's `first` and `last` values, and
that the first and last returned times are `t0` plus the delay, and `t0`
plus the delay plus the shape duration. It checks that the interior points
are the waveform samples unchanged, at `t0` plus the delay plus the
gradient's own sample times (`g.tt`).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_synthetic_sequences_pass_the_timing_check`

**Checks:** Each synthetic sequence builder in `tests/synthetic.py` passes
pypulseq's timing check.

**How:** The test runs once for each of four builders — `spin_echo_sequence`,
`gre_sequence`, `empty_sequence` and `arbitrary_gradient_sequence` — builds
the sequence, calls its `check_timing` method, and asserts that the check
passes, showing the report if it does not.

**Assumptions:**

- pypulseq's timing check is trusted to cover raster alignment, RF dead time
  and ringdown, and ADC dead time before and after the ADC. This test does
  not check the report cards' own reading of the sequence, only that the
  synthetic sequences are legal Pulseq.

### 2.2 PNS levels (`test_pns_levels.py`)

`test_pns_levels.py` tests `pns_levels.py` (`docs/plans/diagram-lanes.md`, section
4.1, item 2, and section 4.2): `pns_levels`, which samples the gradients block by
block (`GradientSampler.block_samples`), runs the SAFE model of the pinned pypulseq
fork (`_safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk`) over them in chunks, and keeps only the stored level
(the minimum and the maximum of the total in fixed time bins) and the summary (the
peak, the peak time and the axis peaks); and `bin_samples_for`, which picks the bin
size. The reference for most tests is `seq.calculate_pns` of the pinned fork
(decision 6 of section 2.2 of the plan: this project does not test pypulseq itself,
only compares this library's output with pypulseq's or with its own other output).
`calc_pns` samples `seq.get_gradients()` at the file times `(k + 0.5) * dt`, which
drift off the ideal raster grid by float rounding of the block start time sums
(section 2.3, item 1, of the plan); `pns_levels` samples each block at its own local
raster times, with no such drift. Both then run the same chunk function, so a
relative 1e-6-of-peak tolerance (section 3.5, item 2, of the plan) covers the whole
difference, except for a file with a block off the gradient raster, where both
sample at file times and a relative 1e-9 suffices.

`pns_levels` takes the hardware of the SAFE model from one of three sources: the
example hardware (`safe_example_hw()`, with no argument), a gradient `.asc` file
(`gradient_asc`), or a pair `(struct, label)` (`hardware`), where `struct` is a SAFE
hardware struct in the form of pypulseq's `asc_to_hw`. The last tests of this section
check the `hardware` keyword against the other two sources, and `SAFE_MODEL` (the
model `pns.safe` of the target profile, which reads and checks the nine fields of each
axis) and `hw_from_dict` (the struct of a checked dict). They compare the results
exactly: the same struct values give the same float operations.

#### `test_summary_matches_calculate_pns_within_the_fork_tolerance`

**Checks:** For a spin echo, a gradient echo, an arbitrary gradient, and a
hand-made "border" sequence (two extended-trapezoid blocks whose gradient is not
zero at the block border between them), `pns_levels`'s peak, peak time and axis
peaks equal `seq.calculate_pns`'s (example hardware) within a relative 1e-6 of the
peak. Also checks `reason`, `hardware`, `asc_file`, `dt_s` and `on_raster` for the
example-hardware, on-raster case.

**How:** Parametrized over `spin_echo_sequence()`, `gre_sequence()`,
`arbitrary_gradient_sequence()` and `synthetic.border_sequence()` (two
`pp.make_extended_trapezoid` blocks on x, the second continuing the first's
amplitude with no step, so `add_block` accepts the junction). The reference peak,
peak time (the first sample at or above `peak * (1 - PEAK_TOLERANCE)`, as
`PnsPrediction.peak_time_s`) and axis peaks come from
`seq.calculate_pns(safe_example_hw(), do_plots=False)`. `pns_levels(seq)`'s fields
are compared with `pytest.approx`: the
peak and axis peaks with `abs = 1e-6 * ref_peak`, the peak time with `abs = 1e-9`
(both use the same `(k + 0.5) * dt` formula, so the same sample index gives the same
float).

**Assumptions:** None of these sequences has two samples close enough together, in
value, to flip which one the tolerance-based peak-time search finds first.

#### `test_stored_bins_match_calculate_pns_totals`

**Checks:** Each stored bin's minimum and maximum equal the minimum and the maximum
of `seq.calculate_pns`'s totals over the same samples, within the same 1e-6-of-peak
tolerance, for the same four sequences.

**How:** Same parametrization and reference call as
`test_summary_matches_calculate_pns_within_the_fork_tolerance`. For each bin `i` of
`pns_levels(seq)`, `s0 = i * bin_samples`, `s1 = min(s0 + bin_samples,
levels.num_samples)` (the last bin can be shorter); the loop stops before a bin
whose `s1` is past the end of `calc_pns`'s own array (shorter than `pns_levels`'s
when a trailing block has no gradient event, for example `gre_sequence`'s TR
padding: `pns_levels` keeps sampling into the filters' own decay past where
`calc_pns` stopped, so a bin that straddles that point is not comparable). Each
compared bin's `level_min[i]`/`level_max[i]` are checked against
`norm[s0:s1].min()`/`.max()` with `pytest.approx(abs = 1e-6 * levels.peak)`. Asserts
at least one bin was compared.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_cast_outward_bounds_every_input_value`

**Checks:** `_cast_outward` (the float32 rounding that keeps every bin's minimum and
maximum outside the float64 samples it was built from) never lands on the wrong
side of its input: the downward cast is at most the input, the upward cast is at
least the input.

**How:** 2000 uniform random float64 values in `[-1000, 1000)`
(`numpy.random.default_rng(0)`). Checks `_cast_outward(values,
down=True).astype(float64) <= values` and `_cast_outward(values,
down=False).astype(float64) >= values` elementwise, and that both results are
`float32`.

**Assumptions:** None of the 2000 values happens to already be exactly representable
in float32 for every one of them (which would make the nudging branch untested);
not arranged, only overwhelmingly likely for uniform random values.

#### `test_bin_samples_for_matches_the_formula`

**Checks:** `bin_samples_for` follows `max(floor(EXACT_MAX_S / (2 * DISPLAY_BINS) /
dt), ceil(num_samples / MAX_BINS), 1)`: 615 samples at the 10 us raster for any file
of up to 1,230,000,000 samples, and a coarser bin above that size or at a coarser
`dt`. A `pns_levels` call on a real sequence follows the same formula and gives that
many bins.

**How:** Direct calls: `bin_samples_for(0, 1e-5) == 615`,
`bin_samples_for(1_230_000_000, 1e-5) == 615`, `bin_samples_for(1_230_000_001, 1e-5)
== 616`, `bin_samples_for(2_000_000_000, 1e-5) == 1000`, `bin_samples_for(0, 2e-5) ==
307`. Then `pns_levels(gre_sequence(num_trs=6))`'s `bin_samples` is compared with
`bin_samples_for(levels.num_samples, levels.dt_s)`, and `len(levels.level_min) ==
len(levels.level_max)` equals the ceiling division of `num_samples` by
`bin_samples`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_result_does_not_depend_on_chunk_samples`

**Checks:** The stored level and the summary do not depend on the chunk size: exact
equality for chunks of 1, 2 and 7 bins and one chunk larger than the whole file.

**How:** `gre_sequence(num_trs=20)`, long enough that the smallest case (1 bin per
chunk) still has more than one chunk. `reference = pns_levels(seq)` (with the
`CHUNK_SAMPLES` of the module); then, for each size in `1`, `bin_samples + 1`,
`7 * bin_samples - 1` and `bin_samples * (num_samples // bin_samples + 10)`,
`monkeypatch.setattr` sets `CHUNK_SAMPLES` of `pulseq_reports.pns_levels` to it and
`pns_levels(seq)` runs again. `pns_levels` rounds the chunk up to a whole number of
bins, so the sizes give chunks of 1, 2 and 7 bins and one chunk bigger than the file.
`level_min`/`level_max` are compared with `numpy.array_equal`; `peak`, `peak_time_s`,
`axis_peaks`, `num_samples` and `bin_samples` with `==`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_no_gradients`

**Checks:** A sequence with no gradient event gives `reason=NO_GRADIENTS`, no
stored bins, a peak of 0, `peak_time_s` of `None`, zero axis peaks, and still the
example hardware and its `hw` fields.

**How:** `pns_levels(empty_sequence())`. Checks `reason`, `hardware`, `asc_file`,
the `(0,)` shape of `level_min`/`level_max`, `peak == 0.0`, `peak_time_s is None`,
`axis_peaks == {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.0}`, and `hw` against the 8 kept fields
of `safe_example_hw()`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_off_raster_block_falls_back_to_sampling`

**Checks:** A file with a block that is not on the gradient raster is reported as
`on_raster=False`, and its peak, peak time and axis peaks equal `seq.calculate_pns`
within a relative 1e-9 of the peak (tighter than the drift-based 1e-6 elsewhere in
this section, because both now sample with `GradientSampler.sample`/
`seq.get_gradients()` at the same file times; `test_sampling.py` established that
those two agree to about float rounding).

**How:** A trapezoid on x followed by `pp.make_delay(1.5 * dt)` (pypulseq's
`add_block` accepts this duration, though it is not a whole number of raster
steps). Compares `pns_levels(seq)`'s `on_raster`, `peak`, `peak_time_s` and
`axis_peaks` with the same-named values from `seq.calculate_pns(safe_example_hw(),
do_plots=False)`, as in `test_summary_matches_calculate_pns_within_the_fork_tolerance`
but with `abs = 1e-9 * ref_peak` (and `abs = 1e-9` for the peak time). It also checks
that `num_samples` is at least the length of `calculate_pns`'s result: `pns_levels`
covers the whole sequence, and `calc_pns` stops at the last gradient point.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_asc_hardware_file_is_used_for_the_levels`

**Checks:** `pns_levels` reads the hardware name and the 8 kept fields of each axis
from a given gradient .asc file, instead of the example hardware, and its stored
level and summary then equal the default (example-hardware) call exactly, because
this .asc file encodes the example hardware's own numbers.

**How:** A local `write_gradient_asc` fixture (the technique of `test_pns.py`'s
fixture of the same name, not its confidential data: real .asc files are
confidential, so this one is built from pypulseq's own public
`safe_example_hw()`) writes an `asCOMP.tName` line and the `flGSWDTau*`,
`flGSWDA*`, `flGSWDStimulationLimit*`/`Threshold*` and `flGScaleFactor*` fields for
each axis. `pns_levels(spin_echo_sequence(), path)`'s `hardware`, `asc_file` and
`hw` are checked, then its `level_min`, `level_max`, `peak` and `peak_time_s` are
compared with a plain `pns_levels(seq)` call (`numpy.array_equal` for the arrays,
`==` for the scalars).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_refuses_rotations`

**Checks:** `pns_levels` raises `NotImplementedError` for a sequence with a
rotation library, as the gradient cards do.

**How:** `gre_sequence(num_trs=2)` with a non-empty `rotation_library` (the
technique of `test_extensions.py`'s `_with_rotation_library`), inside
`pytest.raises(NotImplementedError, match="rotation extension")`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_is_a_frozen_dataclass`

**Checks:** `pns_levels` returns a `PnsLevels` instance.

**How:** `isinstance(pns_levels(spin_echo_sequence()), PnsLevels)`. A smoke test of
the interface; the other tests of this section check individual fields.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_hardware_with_the_example_struct_gives_the_default_levels`

**Checks:** `pns_levels(seq, hardware=(safe_example_hw(), label))` gives the levels of
`pns_levels(seq)`, except `hardware`, which is the label: `asc_file` is None, and each
other field is exactly equal.

**How:** For `spin_echo_sequence()` (on the raster) and for a sequence with a block off
the raster, the test calls both and compares each field of the `PnsLevels` but
`hardware` (`numpy.array_equal` for the arrays, `==` for the rest).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_hardware_from_an_asc_file_gives_the_levels_of_the_file`

**Checks:** `pns_levels(seq, hardware=(asc_to_hw(read_gradient_asc(path)), label))`
gives the levels of `pns_levels(seq, gradient_asc=path)`, except `hardware` (the label)
and `asc_file` (None).

**How:** The local `write_gradient_asc` fixture of this file writes the `.asc` file (the
plain layout; `test_pns.py` tests the layout of a scanner file). The test compares each
field but the two with `numpy.array_equal` and `==`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_refuses_both_gradient_asc_and_hardware`

**Checks:** `pns_levels` with `gradient_asc` and `hardware` together raises
`ValueError`.

**How:** `pns_levels(spin_echo_sequence(), gradient_asc=path, hardware=(safe_example_hw(),
"LABEL"))` inside `pytest.raises(ValueError, match="not both")`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_safe_model_reads_a_valid_dict`

**Checks:** `SAFE_MODEL` has the name `pns.safe` and the version 1. `SAFE_MODEL.read` of
a valid dict gives a new dict, with equal values, and each value is a float, also for an
int in the input. The `name` is optional.

**How:** The test builds the dict from `safe_example_hw()` (`name`, and for `x`, `y` and
`z` the nine fields) and compares `read(params)` with it (`==`, `is not` for the dict and
for one axis, `type(v) is float`). It then reads a dict without `name` (no `name` in the
result) and a dict with an int `stim_limit` (the float of it).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_safe_model_refuses_an_unknown_key`

**Checks:** `SAFE_MODEL.read` raises `ValueError` for a key that is not `name`, `x`, `y`
or `z`, and for a field that is not one of the nine, and the message names the key with
its axis (`extra`, `z.tau4`).

**How:** Parametrized: a valid dict with the key `extra`, and a valid dict with the field
`tau4` in `z`. The test checks the message for `unknown key` and for the key.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_safe_model_refuses_a_missing_field_or_axis`

**Checks:** `SAFE_MODEL.read` raises `ValueError` for a dict without one field of an
axis, or without an axis. The message names the key (`y.a2`, `z`).

**How:** The test deletes `a2` from `y` of a valid dict, then `z` from another, and
matches the message with `missing key`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_safe_model_refuses_a_value_that_is_not_a_real_number`

**Checks:** `SAFE_MODEL.read` raises `ValueError` that names the key (`x.tau2`) for a
field whose value is a bool (`True`, `False`), a str, `None`, a list, NaN or an infinity,
and for a `name` that is not a str.

**How:** Parametrized on the eight values, set as `x.tau2` in a valid dict. A second dict
has `name = 1`.

**Assumptions:** A bool is an int in Python. The model refuses it, so a TOML `true` is
not a number.

#### `test_hw_from_dict_gives_the_example_hardware`

**Checks:** `hw_from_dict(SAFE_MODEL.read(params))` for the example parameters has the
name and the 27 values of `safe_example_hw()`, its name is "unknown" when `params` has
no `name`, and, used as `hardware`, it gives exactly the levels of the example hardware,
except `hardware` (the label).

**How:** The test compares the name and each field of each axis with `==`, then compares
the levels of `spin_echo_sequence()` with `hardware=(hw, label)` with those of
`pns_levels(seq)`, as the first test of this list does.

**Assumptions:** None.

### 2.3 Sequence extensions (`test_extensions.py`)

`test_extensions.py` tests `extensions.refuse_rotations`, the guard that
`cards/spectrum.py`, `cards/pns.py` and `cards/gradient_limits.py` call
before they read any gradient. Task 6.1 of
`docs/plans/diagram-event-table.md` found that pypulseq 1.5.0.post1 cannot
make a rotation and that its `Sequence.read` raises `ValueError` for a
`.seq` file with a rotation section. This file therefore makes its own
rotation sequences by hand, the way pypulseq draft PR #372 stores a
rotation: a `rotation_library` event library on the `pp.Sequence`, a
`"ROTATIONS"` entry in `seq.extension_string_idx`, or, for the one test that
checks a `.seq` file directly, an `[EXTENSIONS]` section and an `extension
ROTATIONS` section written into the file text after `pp.Sequence.write`.

#### `test_refuse_rotations_accepts_synthetic_sequences`

**Checks:** `refuse_rotations` raises nothing for each synthetic sequence
builder in `tests/synthetic.py`: none of them uses the rotation extension.

**How:** The test is parametrized over `spin_echo_sequence`, `gre_sequence`,
`arbitrary_gradient_sequence` and `empty_sequence`. For each, it builds the
sequence and calls `refuse_rotations` on it.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_refuse_rotations_raises_for_a_rotation_library`

**Checks:** `refuse_rotations` raises `NotImplementedError`, with "rotation
extension" in the message, for a sequence with a non-empty
`rotation_library`.

**How:** The test builds a `gre_sequence`, sets its `rotation_library` to a
new `EventLibrary` holding one scalar-first unit quaternion (the format PR
#372 uses), and calls `refuse_rotations` inside `pytest.raises`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_refuse_rotations_raises_for_a_rotations_extension_type`

**Checks:** `refuse_rotations` raises `NotImplementedError`, with "rotation
extension" in the message, for a sequence that has registered the
`"ROTATIONS"` extension type.

**How:** The test builds a `gre_sequence`, calls
`seq.set_extension_string_ID("ROTATIONS", 1)` (as PR #372's `Sequence.read`
does while reading a file with a rotation section), and calls
`refuse_rotations` inside `pytest.raises`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_refuse_rotations_ignores_an_empty_rotation_library`

**Checks:** A `rotation_library` attribute that exists but holds no data is
not a rotation: `refuse_rotations` raises nothing.

**How:** The test builds a `gre_sequence`, sets its `rotation_library` to a
new, empty `EventLibrary`, and calls `refuse_rotations` on it.

**Assumptions:** None.

### 2.4 Sequence index (`test_seq_index.py`)

`test_seq_index.py` tests `seq_index.py` (section 4.1 of
`docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md`): the dense RF, gradient and ADC event numbering of
`sequence_index`, its block times, its dtypes and its cache; `block_cache_off`; and
`rf_events`, `grad_events` and `adc_events`, which read each unique event one time with
the block cache off. The
reference numbering, `_reference_index`, is a plain loop over the blocks with one dict
for each event kind: the loop that `diagram_data.diagram_tables` had before it used the
index. Its `*_first` arrays hold play indexes, as `SequenceIndex` does (the old loop
kept block ids). The tests load `build_repeating` and `build_worst` from
`tests/scale_sequences.py`.

#### `test_dense_columns_and_first_arrays_match_the_reference_numbering`

**Checks:** `sequence_index`'s `rf`, `gx`, `gy`, `gz` and `adc` columns, `rf_first`,
`grad_first`, `grad_first_axis`, `adc_first` and `block_id` equal `_reference_index`'s,
for a synthetic spin echo, gradient echo, empty and arbitrary-gradient sequence, and
for `build_repeating`/`build_worst` at 50 TRs (250 blocks).

**How:** The test is parametrized over the four synthetic builders and two lambdas
wrapping `build_repeating(50)`/`build_worst(50)`. For each, it builds the sequence,
computes `sequence_index(seq)` and `_reference_index(seq)`, and compares every one of
those nine arrays with `numpy.array_equal` (the dense columns cast to `int64` first,
since `sequence_index` narrows their dtype while the reference always uses `int64`).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_grad_dense_numbering_follows_gx_then_gy_then_gz_within_a_block`

**Checks:** The dense numbering of gradient events follows gx before gy before gz
within one block, and reusing an already-numbered event on a different axis of a later
block does not add a new dense index, with the expected numbers worked out by hand.

**How:** The test builds a 3-block sequence by hand: block 0 has only a gz trapezoid;
block 1 has a gx and a gy trapezoid, each a different amplitude; block 2 reuses block
0's gz trapezoid object (a shallow copy with its `channel` changed to `"x"`) on gx. It
checks `index.gx`, `gy`, `gz`, `grad_first` and `grad_first_axis` against the
hand-worked values, then checks that `grad_events` yields the three events in dense
order 1, 2, 3 with the expected amplitudes (1e5, 2e5, 3e5).

**Assumptions:**

- pypulseq's gradient library keys an event by its shape and amplitude data, not by
  the channel it is later read from, so the same trapezoid object can be reused on a
  different axis and keep the same library id. This was checked directly against
  `seq.block_events` and `seq.grad_library` while writing this test; the test itself
  then relies on it to make the hand-worked expected numbers correct.

#### `test_start_s_is_the_sequential_sum_and_end_s_is_its_final_value`

**Checks:** `index.start_s` is the sequential sum of the block durations from 0.0,
`index.end_s` is that sum's final value, and `index.duration_s` is
`seq.block_durations` in play order.

**How:** The test builds `build_repeating(50)`, computes `sequence_index(seq)`, and
independently walks `seq.block_events.keys()` with a running total `t` (starting at
0.0, recording `t` before adding each block's own duration from
`seq.block_durations`). It compares `index.start_s` to that running list with
`numpy.array_equal`, `index.end_s` to the final `t` with `==`, and `index.duration_s`
to a plain array of the `seq.block_durations` values in play order with
`numpy.array_equal`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_dtype_is_uint8_for_a_sequence_with_few_unique_events`

**Checks:** For a sequence with 255 or fewer unique events of each kind, every one of
`sequence_index`'s dense columns (`rf`, `gx`, `gy`, `gz`, `adc`) has dtype `uint8`.

**How:** The test builds `gre_sequence()` (the default 4 TRs), checks that
`rf_first`, `grad_first` and `adc_first` each have at most 255 entries, and checks the
dtype of each of the five dense columns.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_dtype_widens_to_uint16_past_255_unique_gradient_events`

**Checks:** Once a sequence has more than 255 unique gradient events, `gx`, `gy` and
`gz` widen to `uint16`.

**How:** The test builds `build_repeating(260)`. `build_repeating`'s phase-encode
table has 256 amplitudes (`PE_STEPS`), so 260 TRs give more than 255 unique gradient
events overall (the phase-encode events, plus the readout and the spoiler, each reused
every TR). It checks that `grad_first` has more than 255 entries and that `gx`, `gy`
and `gz` have dtype `uint16`.

**Assumptions:**

- `build_repeating`'s phase-encode table size (`PE_STEPS = 256` in
  `tests/scale_sequences.py`) is large enough, on its own, to push the total past 255
  once combined with the readout and spoiler events; this is read from that script,
  not re-derived here.

#### `test_sequence_index_of_a_sequence_with_no_blocks`

**Checks:** `sequence_index` of a `pp.Sequence` with no blocks added has `num_blocks`
0, `end_s` 0.0, and every array (`block_id`, `start_s`, `duration_s`, `rf`, `gx`,
`gy`, `gz`, `adc`, `rf_first`, `grad_first`, `grad_first_axis`, `adc_first`) empty.

**How:** The test builds `pp.Sequence(SYSTEM)` with no `add_block` call, computes
`sequence_index(seq)`, and checks `num_blocks`, `end_s`, and the size of each of the
twelve arrays.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_sequence_index_is_kept_for_one_sequence_object_and_rebuilt_after_add_block`

**Checks:** `sequence_index(seq)` returns the same object on a second call for the
same sequence, and a new, longer index after `add_block`.

**How:** The test builds `gre_sequence()`, calls `sequence_index(seq)` twice and
checks the two results are the same object (`is`), then calls
`seq.add_block(pp.make_delay(1e-3))` and checks that a third call returns a different
object whose `num_blocks` is one more than the first.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_cache_off_restores_use_block_cache_true`

**Checks:** `block_cache_off` sets `use_block_cache` to `False` inside the block, and
restores it to `True` afterward when that was the value beforehand.

**How:** The test sets `seq.use_block_cache = True`, checks it is `False` inside
`block_cache_off`, and checks it is `True` again afterward.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_cache_off_restores_use_block_cache_false`

**Checks:** `block_cache_off` sets `use_block_cache` to `False` inside the block, and
restores it to `False` afterward when that was already the value beforehand.

**How:** The test sets `seq.use_block_cache = False`, checks it is still `False`
inside `block_cache_off`, and checks it is `False` again afterward.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_cache_off_restores_the_old_value_after_an_exception`

**Checks:** `block_cache_off` restores the old `use_block_cache` value even when an
exception is raised inside the block.

**How:** The test sets `seq.use_block_cache = True`, raises a `ValueError` inside
`block_cache_off` (after checking it reads `False` there), catches it with
`pytest.raises`, and checks `use_block_cache` is `True` again afterward.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_cache_off_does_not_remove_blocks_already_in_the_cache`

**Checks:** `block_cache_off` does not remove a block that was already in
`seq.block_cache` before it ran.

**How:** The test builds `gre_sequence()`, calls `seq.get_block` on the first block id
to populate the cache, checks it is in `seq.block_cache`, runs an empty
`block_cache_off` block, and checks the block is still in `seq.block_cache` afterward.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_rf_events_reads_each_unique_event_once_with_the_cache_off`

**Checks:** `rf_events` calls `seq.get_block` exactly once for each unique RF event,
with the block cache off during every call and restored afterward; it yields dense
indexes 1 to K in order; and each yielded event equals the same block's `rf` event
read separately.

**How:** The test builds `spin_echo_sequence()` (two distinct RF events), wraps
`seq.get_block` with a counting wrapper (monkeypatched onto the instance) that also
records `seq.use_block_cache` at each call, sets `seq.use_block_cache = True`, and
calls `rf_events(seq, index)`, collecting its results. It checks the call count
against the number of unique first-use blocks (`numpy.unique(index.rf_first).size`),
that every recorded cache flag is `False`, and that `use_block_cache` is `True` again
afterward. It checks the yielded dense indexes are 1 to K in order, and, for each
result, that its `delay`, `type` and `signal` equal the `rf` attribute of
`seq.get_block(block_id)` read again through the saved, unwrapped `get_block`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_grad_events_reads_each_unique_first_use_block_once_with_the_cache_off`

**Checks:** `grad_events` calls `seq.get_block` exactly once for each distinct
first-use block, not once for each unique gradient event, when two axes of one block
are both first uses; the block cache is off during every call and restored afterward;
the yielded dense indexes are 1 to K in order; and each yielded event equals the
corresponding axis attribute of that block, read separately.

**How:** The test builds a 3-block sequence where block 1 introduces both a gx and a
gy event (so it is the first-use block of two dense indexes at once), wraps
`seq.get_block` as in the RF test, and calls `grad_events(seq, index)`. It checks the
call count is 2 (the two distinct first-use blocks, not the three dense events), that
every recorded cache flag is `False`, and that `use_block_cache` is restored to
`True`. It checks the yielded dense indexes are 1, 2, 3 in order, and, for each, that
its `delay`, `type` and `amplitude` equal the `gx`/`gy`/`gz` attribute (picked by
`grad_first_axis`) of that block, read separately with the saved, unwrapped
`get_block`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_adc_events_reads_each_unique_event_once_with_the_cache_off`

**Checks:** `adc_events` calls `seq.get_block` exactly once for the sequence's one
unique ADC event (reused every TR), with the block cache off during the call and
restored afterward, and the yielded event equals that block's `adc` attribute read
separately.

**How:** The test builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=5)`, whose ADC event is the same
object reused every TR, and repeats the wrapper technique of the RF and gradient
tests. It checks the call count is 1, that the recorded cache flag is `False`, that
`use_block_cache` is restored to `True`, and that the yielded event's `delay`,
`num_samples` and `dwell` equal the `adc` attribute of that block read separately.

**Assumptions:** None.

### 2.5 Raster sampler (`test_sampling.py`)

`test_sampling.py` tests `sampling.py` (section 4.3 of
`docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md`): `GradientSampler`, which gives the gradient waveform of one axis at sorted times, from
the sequence index and the unique gradient events. The reference is pypulseq's
`seq.get_gradients()`: `_assert_matches_pypulseq` compares `sample(axis, t)` with the
`PPoly` of each axis at the same times, within a relative 1e-12 and an absolute 1e-12
times the largest |value| of the reference (section 3.5, item 2, of the plan). They are
not bit-exact: `seq_utils.gradient_offsets` adds a trapezoid's corner times in a
different order than pypulseq's `waveforms()`, and `PPoly` evaluates a line segment with
a different formula than `numpy.interp`. The comparison checks `GradientSampler`, not
pypulseq.

#### `test_whole_file_matches_pypulseq_for_synthetic_sequences`

**Checks:** For each of the four synthetic sequence builders (a spin echo, a gradient
echo, the arbitrary gradient, and the empty sequence), `GradientSampler.sample` gives
the same three-axis waveform as `seq.get_gradients()`, sampled at the raster centres
of the whole file.

**How:** Parametrized over `spin_echo_sequence()`, `gre_sequence()`,
`arbitrary_gradient_sequence()` and `empty_sequence()`. For each, `t` is
`(k + 0.5) * grad_raster_time` for `k` in `range(ceil(duration / raster))`, with
`duration` the sequence index's `end_s`; the test compares all three axes against
`seq.get_gradients()` with `_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:**

- None of these raster-centre times falls within `get_gradients()`'s excluded 1e-12 s
  band around the first or last point of an axis (the `teps` zero points it adds); this
  was not arranged, only observed to hold for these four sequences.

#### `test_subrange_that_cuts_blocks_matches_pypulseq`

**Checks:** A sample range that starts in the middle of one block and ends in the
middle of another gives the same waveform as `seq.get_gradients()` on all three axes,
including an axis whose only event in the file is entirely before the range.

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=1)` (5 blocks: RF, phase-encode on y, readout on
x with an ADC, spoiler on z, delay). `t` is 500 evenly spaced points from the middle of
block 2 (the readout, which the range cuts) to the middle of block 4 (the delay, after
the spoiler); the phase-encode event of block 1 is entirely before this range, so it
also checks that gy is 0 for the rest of the file after its one event. Compares with
`_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_subrange_inside_a_gap_matches_pypulseq`

**Checks:** A sample range entirely inside a gap between two gradient events on the
same axis (a block with no event of its own) still gives the pypulseq value: a
straight line between the earlier event's last point and the later event's first
point.

**How:** Builds a trapezoid on x, a 2 ms delay block, and a second trapezoid on x. `t`
is 200 evenly spaced points strictly inside the delay block, 50 µs in from each edge.
Compares with `_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_single_sample_matches_pypulseq`

**Checks:** `sample` gives the pypulseq value for a `t` array of length 1.

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=1)`, samples at one time (the middle of the
readout block), and compares with `_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_amplitude_continues_across_a_block_junction`

**Checks:** Two extended trapezoids that together make one trapezoid, split into two
blocks at the middle of the flat top so the amplitude continues unchanged from one
block into the next, give the same waveform as `seq.get_gradients()` around the
junction: the join rule's dropped point does not create a spurious step.

**How:** `_junction_sequence(step_hz_per_m=0.0)` builds the two extended trapezoids
from the rise, flat and fall of one area-1000 trapezoid, split at the middle of the
flat top, and returns the junction time. `t` is 41 points evenly spaced over 40
gradient-raster periods centred on the junction. Compares with
`_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_tolerated_step_at_a_block_junction_matches_pypulseq`

**Checks:** A step at a block junction that is inside what pypulseq's `add_block`
accepts (up to `max_slew * grad_raster_time`) still gives the same waveform as
`seq.get_gradients()`: the join rule keeps the value of the earlier event at the
junction time even when the two events do not meet exactly.

**How:** Same construction as `test_amplitude_continues_across_a_block_junction`, with
`_junction_sequence`'s `step_hz_per_m` set to half of `max_slew * grad_raster_time`
instead of 0. The test does not check that `add_block` accepts the step; that is
pypulseq's own check, exercised here only because building the sequence requires it to
pass.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_triangle_trapezoid_matches_pypulseq`

**Checks:** A trapezoid with no flat time (`make_trapezoid` gives `flat_time == 0.0`),
whose `gradient_offsets` therefore has two points at the same time with the same
value, gives the same waveform as `seq.get_gradients()`: the join rule's
duplicate-point removal does not change the value.

**How:** Builds a single-block sequence with one small-area trapezoid on x, asserts
`flat_time == 0.0` to confirm the construction is the intended triangle, samples the
whole file at the raster centres, and compares with `_assert_matches_pypulseq`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_sample_matches_the_added_events_for_an_oversampled_arbitrary_gradient`

**Checks:** `sample` gives the correct waveform for a file with an oversampled
arbitrary gradient (`make_arbitrary_grad(oversampling=True)`): B4 of
`docs/reviews/2026-09-28-code-review.md` (pypulseq issue #423), fixed by the project's
pypulseq pin (`pulseq-reports-pin-1`, the fix of pypulseq PR #424). The reference is not
`seq.get_gradients()`: pypulseq's `waveforms()` leaves out the first and the last point
of an oversampled gradient (a separate pypulseq bug, draft 03 of
`github.com/mdtisdall/pypulseq-issues`), so `_assert_matches_pypulseq`'s own reference
would be wrong for this event by construction, not only by the bug under test. The
reference is instead the polyline of the added events (the objects `make_*` returns,
before `add_block`), which does not depend on either pypulseq bug.

**How:** Builds three blocks with `SYSTEM` of `synthetic.py`: an oversampled ramp
(`make_arbitrary_grad("x", ..., oversampling=True)`, 21 samples at 50 % of `max_slew`
over half a raster, ending at a value that is not 0), an extended trapezoid back down to
0, and an ordinary trapezoid. The waveform is kept within the real `max_slew` by the
test itself, because `make_arbitrary_grad(oversampling=True)` checks the slew rate 4
times too leniently (pypulseq issue #421). The reference polyline is built from each
added event's own corner or sample points (`[0, *g.tt, g.shape_dur]` and `[g.first,
*g.waveform, g.last]` for the arbitrary and extended-trapezoid events, the rise/flat/fall
corners for the trapezoid), offset by each block's start (`numpy.cumsum` of
`seq.block_durations`) and the event's own delay, with a point dropped when it is not
more than 1e-9 s after the point before it (the same join rule as `GradientSampler`).
`GradientSampler.sample("gx", t)` is compared with `numpy.interp` on that polyline at
3999 points evenly spaced over the file, within an absolute 1e-12 times the peak of the
reference (`rtol=0`). Before the pin's fix, this test's own error is about 40 % of the
peak (checked against a pypulseq checkout at the old pin, `20b9e5e`).

**Assumptions:**

- The pin (`pulseq-reports-pin-1`) has the fix of pypulseq PR #424. A pypulseq without
  it fails this test: checked against a checkout of the old pin (`20b9e5e`).

#### `test_axis_without_events_is_zero`

**Checks:** An axis with no gradient event anywhere in the file (`get_gradients()`
gives `None` for it) samples to exactly 0 at every time.

**How:** Builds `spin_echo_sequence()` (gx and gy only), asserts
`seq.get_gradients()[2] is None` to document that gz has no event, samples gz at the
raster centres of the whole file, and checks the result against `numpy.zeros` with
`numpy.testing.assert_array_equal` (an exact check, not a tolerance).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_zero_before_the_first_event_and_after_the_last`

**Checks:** The waveform is exactly 0 before the first gradient event of the file and
after the last one.

**How:** Builds a delay block, one trapezoid on x, and a second delay block. Samples
50 points inside the first delay block (before the event) and 50 points inside the
second delay block (after the event), and checks both against `numpy.zeros` exactly.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_empty_sequence_is_zero_for_any_t`

**Checks:** A sequence with no gradient event on any axis gives exactly 0 for any `t`,
including a time past the sequence's own duration.

**How:** Builds `empty_sequence()` (one delay block; no RF, gradients or ADC). Samples
all three axes at `t = [0.0, 1e-3, 5.0]` (5.0 s is far past the sequence's 2 ms), and
checks each result against `numpy.zeros` exactly, with `dtype == float64`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_empty_times_gives_empty_output`

**Checks:** `sample` with an empty `t` returns an empty `float64` array, not an error.

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=1)`, calls `sample("gx", numpy.array([]))`, and
checks the result's dtype and shape.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_invalid_axis_name_raises_value_error`

**Checks:** `sample` raises `ValueError` for an axis name other than "gx", "gy" or
"gz".

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=1)`, calls `sample("gw", ...)` inside
`pytest.raises(ValueError)`.

**Assumptions:** None.

The remaining tests of this section are for `GradientSampler.block_samples` and
`raster_block_lengths` (`docs/plans/diagram-lanes.md`, phase 2, task 2.0, section 4.1,
item 3): the PNS lane's per-block samples at the local times `(j + 0.5) * dt`, 0 before
a block's first gradient point and after its last, with no line across a gap and no
time drift from the block start sums. This is the rule of `PnsLanes` (`_eventSamples`
in `assets/pns_lanes.js`), not the rule of `sample`.

#### `test_block_samples_matches_sample_at_file_raster_times`

**Checks:** `block_samples` over all the blocks of a file agrees with `sample` at the
file times `(k + 0.5) * dt`, within 1e-9 of the largest |g| of the axis, for the
spin-echo, gradient-echo and arbitrary-gradient synthetic sequences.

**How:** Parametrized over `spin_echo_sequence()`, `gre_sequence()` and
`arbitrary_gradient_sequence()`. `raster_block_lengths(index, dt)` gives each block's
sample count and confirms the file is on the raster; `t_file` is `(k + 0.5) * dt` for
`k` in `range(total_samples)`. For each axis, `block_samples(axis, 0, num_blocks, dt)`
is compared with `sample(axis, t_file)` with `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`, `atol =
1e-9 * peak` and `rtol = 0`, `peak` the largest `|value|` of `sample`'s result. The two
are not exactly equal: `block_samples` computes each block's samples from its own local
raster grid, with no accumulated float error, while `sample` reads the waveform at the
block's actual start time (the sequential sum of the durations before it), which drifts
off the ideal raster grid by float rounding (`docs/plans/diagram-lanes.md`, section 2.3,
item 1). The difference is that drift only.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_hand_made_ramp_and_no_event_block`

**Checks:** `block_samples` gives the exact values of a hand-made sequence: a gradient
that ramps to a nonzero value and stops there (unlike an ordinary trapezoid, whose
event is 0 at both ends), inside a block longer than the ramp, and a later block with
no gradient event on any axis.

**How:** Builds a two-block sequence: block 0 has `pp.make_extended_trapezoid` on x,
ramping from 0 to `amp = 1000.0` Hz/m over `n_ramp = 4` raster steps, and
`pp.make_trapezoid` on z with an explicit `duration` of `n_block = 7` raster steps (so
the block is longer than the x ramp); block 1 is `pp.make_delay(n_block * dt)`, with no
gradient event at all. The expected x samples of block 0 are computed by hand from the
linear-interpolation rule (`amp * t / rise` while `t` is before the ramp's own last
point, 0 after it) and compared with `numpy.testing.assert_allclose` (`rtol = atol =
1e-12`): a division (the same rule, computed by a different sequence of floating-point
operations) makes exact equality unlikely. gy, which has no event anywhere in the file,
and block 1's gx and gz, which have no event in that block, are checked against exact
zero with `numpy.testing.assert_array_equal`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_range_inside_the_file_equals_the_same_slice_of_the_whole_file`

**Checks:** `block_samples` for a range that starts and ends inside the file gives
exactly the same values as the matching slice of `block_samples` for the whole file.

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=3)`. `raster_block_lengths` gives each block's
sample count, used to find the sample offset and length of a block range `[2, num_blocks
- 1)`. For each axis, `block_samples(axis, 0, num_blocks, dt)` and `block_samples(axis,
2, num_blocks - 1, dt)` are compared with `numpy.array_equal` after slicing the whole-file
result to the same sample offset and length.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_samples_invalid_axis_name_raises_value_error`

**Checks:** `block_samples` raises `ValueError` for an axis name other than "gx", "gy"
or "gz".

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=1)`, calls `block_samples("gw", 0, 1, dt)` inside
`pytest.raises(ValueError)`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_samples_bad_range_raises_value_error`

**Checks:** `block_samples` raises `ValueError` when `first`/`stop` are outside `0 <=
first <= stop <= num_blocks`: a negative `first`, a `first` greater than `stop`, and a
`stop` past the number of blocks.

**How:** Parametrized over `(first, stop) = (-1, 1)`, `(3, 1)` and `(0, 100)` on
`gre_sequence(num_trs=1)` (5 blocks), each inside `pytest.raises(ValueError)`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_block_samples_off_raster_block_raises_value_error`

**Checks:** `block_samples` raises `ValueError` for a block whose duration is not a
whole number of raster steps.

**How:** `pp.make_delay(1.5 * dt)` (pypulseq accepts this duration), the block's own
sequence, and `block_samples("gx", 0, 1, dt)` inside `pytest.raises(ValueError)`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_raster_block_lengths_with_different_block_lengths`

**Checks:** `raster_block_lengths` gives `round(duration / dt)` for each block of a
file whose blocks do not all have the same duration, and reports the file as on the
raster.

**How:** Builds `gre_sequence(num_trs=2)` (RF, phase-encode, readout, spoiler and delay
blocks, of different durations; confirmed with `len(set(index.duration_s.tolist())) >
1`). Compares `raster_block_lengths(index, dt)`'s `n` with `numpy.rint(index.duration_s
/ dt)` cast to `int64`, with `numpy.testing.assert_array_equal`, and checks `on_raster`
is `True`.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_raster_block_lengths_detects_a_block_off_the_raster`

**Checks:** `raster_block_lengths` reports a file as not on the raster when one block's
duration is not within `ON_RASTER_TOLERANCE` samples of a whole number, while still
giving a sample count (the nearest whole number) for every block.

**How:** A two-block sequence: `pp.make_delay(2 * dt)`, then `pp.make_delay(1.5 *
dt)`. `raster_block_lengths(index, dt)` must give `on_raster = False` and `n =
[2, 2]` (`numpy.rint` rounds 1.5 to 2, ties-to-even).

**Assumptions:** None.

### 2.6 Gradient limits (`test_grad_limits.py`)

`test_grad_limits.py` tests `grad_limits.py`: the peak amplitude, the peak slew
rate and the RMS amplitude of a sequence's gradients, on each logical axis and
as a three-axis vector, over the whole sequence or over a window. Every
expected value is computed by hand from the parameters of the trapezoid or
arbitrary gradient that the test builds, not by calling `gradient_limits`
itself for the expected value.

Since phase 4 of `docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md`, `grad_limits.py` computes its values from
the per-event values of `seq_index.grad_events` and the columns of `seq_index.sequence_index`,
instead of reading every block with `get_block`, and its slew also includes the step at each
block junction (decision 6 of section 2.5 of that plan). The tests below the first group add:
the largest slew of an arbitrary gradient and of an extended trapezoid (computed from the
event's own corner points, the same way as the peak amplitude tests above), the credited block
for a value that several blocks and axes share, a window that keeps only part of a ramp's
slew, the vector peak of two blocks with different triples of active gradients, the three
junction-step cases of section 4.6 item 6, a window that starts inside a block after a
junction step, and comparisons with the oracle
(`tests/oracles/grad_limits.py`, the implementation from before phase 4).

#### `test_trapezoid_peak_slew_and_rms_match_hand_computed_values`

**Checks:** For a single x trapezoid, `gradient_limits` gives the peak
amplitude, the peak slew rate and the RMS amplitude that hand computation from
the trapezoid's own rise time, flat time and amplitude predicts.

**How:** The test builds one block with an x trapezoid of a given amplitude,
rise time and flat time, and calls `gradient_limits` on it. It computes the
expected peak as the amplitude in mT/m, the expected slew as the amplitude
divided by the rise time in T/m/s, and the expected RMS from the energy of the
two ramps (each `amplitude^2 * rise_time / 3`) plus the flat top
(`amplitude^2 * flat_time`), divided by the block's duration and square
rooted. It checks that the x axis result matches each expected value, that
`reason` is None, and that the peak and the slew are attributed to the
trapezoid's own block ID.

**Assumptions:**

- The trapezoid's `fall_time` equals its `rise_time`, which is
  `pp.make_trapezoid`'s default when only `rise_time` is given.

#### `test_same_trapezoid_on_x_and_y_gives_vector_peak_root_2_times_axis_peak`

**Checks:** The same trapezoid, played on x and on y at the same time, gives a
vector peak that is the axis peak times the square root of 2.

**How:** The test builds one block with the same trapezoid on x and on y, and
calls `gradient_limits`. Because Gx equals Gy at every point, `|G|` is
`sqrt(2)` times `|Gx|` at every point, and so at the peak. It checks that the
vector peak equals the x axis peak times `sqrt(2)`, and that the x and y axis
peaks are equal.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_window_that_cuts_a_ramp_gives_hand_computed_rms`

**Checks:** A window that ends partway up a trapezoid's rising ramp gives an
RMS amplitude equal to the value hand-computed from the piece that the window
keeps, cut at the window edge.

**How:** The test builds one block with an x trapezoid and a window from 0 to
half the rise time. It computes the expected RMS from the one linear piece the
window keeps, from `(0, 0)` to `(rise_time / 2, amplitude / 2)`, with
`Delta t * (a^2 + a*b + b^2) / 3` divided by the window length. It checks that
`range_s` equals the window and that the x axis RMS matches.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_arbitrary_gradient_peak_is_the_largest_of_first_last_and_waveform`

**Checks:** For an arbitrary gradient, the peak amplitude is the largest
absolute value among the shape's `first`, `last` and interior waveform
samples.

**How:** The test builds an x arbitrary gradient from an asymmetric sine-lobe
waveform, whose largest magnitude is not at the shape's first or last sample,
and calls `gradient_limits`. It computes the expected peak as the largest of
`abs(first)`, `abs(last)` and the largest absolute waveform sample, taken from
the block's own gradient event, converted to mT/m. It checks that the x axis
peak matches.

**Assumptions:**

- `seq_utils.gradient_points` adds `first` and `last` as extra points at the
  ends of an arbitrary gradient's shape (checked by `test_gradient_points_arbitrary`
  in `test_seq_utils.py`), so they can hold the largest magnitude even when
  every interior waveform sample is smaller.

#### `test_no_gradients_sets_reason`

**Checks:** A sequence with no gradient events at all gives a set `reason`,
and every numeric field is its zero value: 0.0 for an amplitude, slew or RMS
field, and None for a block field.

**How:** The test builds a sequence with one delay block and no gradients, and
calls `gradient_limits`. It checks that `reason` is
"no gradient events in the sequence", that the vector peak and its time are
0.0, and that every axis's peak, slew and RMS are 0.0 with `peak_block` and
`slew_block` both None.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_default_limits_come_from_seq_system`

**Checks:** With `limits=None`, the limits are `seq.system.max_grad` and
`seq.system.max_slew`, converted to mT/m and T/m/s, with the label
"pypulseq system limits".

**How:** The test builds a sequence with one x trapezoid and calls
`gradient_limits` with no `limits` argument. It checks that the result's
`limits.label` is "pypulseq system limits", and that `max_grad_mt_per_m` and
`max_slew_t_per_m_per_s` equal `seq.system.max_grad` and `seq.system.max_slew`
converted with the gyromagnetic ratio, the same conversion the function itself
documents.

**Assumptions:**

- `seq.system.max_grad` and `seq.system.max_slew` are always in Hz/m and
  Hz/m/s, whatever unit was given to `pp.Opts`, because `pp.Opts` converts to
  Hz/m (respectively Hz/m/s) before it stores the value. This is a fact about
  pypulseq, not about the function under test, and is not itself checked here.

#### `test_arbitrary_gradient_max_slew_is_the_largest_neighbouring_slope`

**Checks:** The largest slew of an arbitrary gradient is the largest
`|delta g / delta t|` between its neighbouring corner points (the shape's
`first`, its waveform samples, and its `last`).

**How:** The test builds an x arbitrary gradient from an asymmetric sine-lobe
waveform and calls `gradient_limits`. It computes the expected slew from
`block.gx.first`, `block.gx.waveform`, `block.gx.last` and their own offset
and shape-duration fields (the same corner points `gradient_offsets` builds),
as the largest `|diff(amplitude) / diff(time)|`, not by calling
`gradient_limits` for the expected value. It checks that the x axis slew
matches.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_extended_trapezoid_max_slew_is_the_largest_segment_slope`

**Checks:** The largest slew of an extended trapezoid is the largest
`|delta g / delta t|` between its neighbouring control points.

**How:** The test builds an x extended trapezoid from five explicit times and
amplitudes and calls `gradient_limits`. It computes the expected slew as the
largest `|diff(amplitudes) / diff(times)|` of the same arrays given to
`make_extended_trapezoid`. It checks that the x axis slew matches.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_largest_over_several_blocks_and_axes_credits_the_first_block_with_that_value`

**Checks:** With several blocks on several axes, the peak amplitude and the
peak slew of each axis are the largest over every block with an event on that
axis, credited to the first block, in play order, whose event reaches that
value; a later block that repeats the very same event does not move the
credit.

**How:** The test builds four blocks: a small x trapezoid, a y trapezoid, a
larger x trapezoid, and the same larger x trapezoid again. It checks that the
x axis peak and slew equal the larger trapezoid's own amplitude and slew
(divided by its rise time), each credited to the third block (the first
block with that event, not the fourth), and that the y axis peak equals the y
trapezoid's amplitude.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_window_that_cuts_a_ramp_gives_the_slew_of_the_part_inside_the_window`

**Checks:** A window that includes only part of an extended trapezoid, over a
segment with a smaller slope than another segment outside the window: the
slew over the window is the slope of the part inside the window, not the
largest slope of the whole event, and the slew time is the window start, where
the window cuts that segment.

**How:** The test builds an x extended trapezoid with four segments of
different slopes and a window that lies inside the two segments with the
smallest slopes, excluding the segment with the largest. It computes the
expected slew by hand from the times and amplitudes of the segment the window
keeps. It checks that the x axis slew matches, not the whole event's own
largest segment slope, and that `slew_time_s` is the window start (100 µs).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_slew_time_is_the_start_of_the_steepest_segment`

**Checks:** The slew time of an axis is the start of its steepest segment.

**How:** The test builds one x extended trapezoid whose last segment (900 to
1100 µs) is its steepest. It checks that the x slew is that segment's slope,
computed by hand, and that `slew_time_s` is 900 µs.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_vector_peak_of_g_compares_different_triples_across_blocks`

**Checks:** Two blocks with different triples of active gradients: the
vector peak of `|G|` is the largest magnitude found across the two different
triples, not just the largest single-axis peak, and the vector peak block and
time are those of the block that reaches it.

**How:** The test builds one block with a large x trapezoid alone, and a
second block with a smaller, equal-amplitude trapezoid on both x and y (whose
combined vector magnitude, `sqrt(2)` times the smaller amplitude, is larger
than the first block's lone peak). It checks that the vector peak equals the
hand-computed combined magnitude of the second block's triple, that
`vector_peak_block` is the second block, and that `vector_peak_time_s` is the
end of the second block's rise (1.0 ms, after the 0.8 ms of the first block).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_junction_step_between_extended_trapezoids_is_reported_as_the_slew`

**Checks:** A step at the junction between two extended trapezoids, within
the tolerance that `add_block` accepts (`max_slew * grad_raster_time`) and
larger than any segment's own slope: the reported slew is the step divided
by `grad_raster_time`, credited to the block after the junction, at the time
of the junction.

**How:** The test builds two x extended trapezoids whose junction step is 90%
of the largest step `add_block` accepts, and whose own segment slopes are
smaller than that step. It computes the expected slew by hand as the step
divided by `grad_raster_time`. It checks that the x axis slew matches, is
credited to the second block, and that `slew_time_s` is the junction (0.2 ms).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_gradient_ending_non_zero_before_a_block_with_no_gradient_is_a_junction_step`

**Checks:** A gradient that ends at a non-zero value (within the tolerance
`add_block` accepts) right before a block with no gradient on that axis: the
junction step uses 0 for the block with no event, and is credited to that
block (the block after the junction).

**How:** The test builds an x extended trapezoid ending at 90% of the largest
step `add_block` accepts, followed by a delay block with no gradient. It
computes the expected slew by hand as that ending value divided by
`grad_raster_time`. It checks that the x axis slew matches and is credited to
the delay block.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_first_block_not_starting_at_zero_is_a_junction_step_before_the_first_block`

**Checks:** A first block whose gradient starts at a non-zero value within
the tolerance `add_block` accepts: the junction before the first block uses 0
for "the block before" (there is none), and is credited to the first block.

**How:** The test builds a single x extended trapezoid starting at 90% of the
largest step `add_block` accepts. It computes the expected slew by hand as
that starting value divided by `grad_raster_time`. It checks that the x axis
slew matches and is credited to the first (only) block.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_window_inside_a_block_with_no_gradient_ignores_the_junction_before_it`

**Checks:** A window entirely inside a block with no gradient, right after a gradient
event that ends at a non-zero value (within the tolerance `add_block` accepts) in the
block before: the window does not use the junction between the two blocks, because
that block starts before the window (`docs/plans/review-bugs.md`, B1, decision 14), so
the window has no gradient event and 0 slew. A window that starts exactly at that
junction still uses it.

**How:** The test builds an x extended trapezoid ending at 90% of the largest step
`add_block` accepts, followed by a delay block with no gradient. It calls
`gradient_limits` with a window from partway into the delay block to its end, and
checks that `reason` is "no gradient events in the window", the x slew is 0.0, and
`slew_block` is None. It then calls `gradient_limits` with a window that starts
exactly at the junction (the end of the trapezoid block) and checks that the x slew
equals the ending value divided by `grad_raster_time` and is credited to the delay
block.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_window_that_cuts_a_block_credits_it_on_a_tie_with_a_later_block`

**Checks:** When a block that the window start cuts and a later block fully inside the
window reach the same peak and the same slew, both are credited to the cut block, the first
in play order, as a single pass over the blocks would (finding L3 of
`docs/reviews/2026-09-28-code-review.md`). The peak time and the vector peak time are the
first time the cut block reaches the peak.

**How:** The test builds two blocks with the same x trapezoid (rise 0.2 ms, flat 0.4 ms,
fall 0.2 ms), then a delay block. The window starts at 0.4 ms, in the flat top of block 1,
so block 1's fall ramp and all of block 2 are inside the window. It checks that the x
`peak_block` and `slew_block` are block 1, and that the x `peak_time_s` and
`vector_peak_time_s` are 0.4 ms, the window start.

**Assumptions:** The slope of block 1's fall ramp, clipped by the window, equals bit for bit
the slope of the same event in block 2, because block 1 starts at 0 and the clip keeps the
ramp's own corner points. The oracle is not used: it computes slopes from absolute corner
times, so its slope of block 2 differs by a rounding error.

#### `test_vector_peak_time_on_a_tie_is_the_first_time_in_play_order`

**Checks:** When two blocks with different triples of events reach the same |G| peak, the
vector peak time is the first time the earlier block reaches it, not a time in the later
block, and the vector peak block is the earlier block. The triples are found with
`numpy.unique`, whose order is not the play order.

**How:** The test builds the same trapezoid on x in block 1 and on y in block 2, and checks
that `vector_peak_time_s` is 0.2 ms, the end of block 1's rise, and that
`vector_peak_block` is block 1.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_axis_whose_only_event_is_zero_credits_no_block`

**Checks:** An axis whose only event has amplitude 0 has a peak and a slew of 0, and no block
is credited for either (`peak_block` and `slew_block` are None).

**How:** The test builds one block with an x trapezoid and a y trapezoid scaled to amplitude
0 with `pp.scale_grad`, and checks the y axis's peak, slew and block fields.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_matches_oracle_on_synthetic_sequences`

**Checks:** `gradient_limits` matches the oracle (`tests/oracles/grad_limits.py`, the
implementation from before phase 4 of `docs/plans/cards-at-scale.md`) on the whole file, and
on a window covering the first half of the sequence, for each of `tests/synthetic.py`'s
sequences (parametrized: `spin_echo_sequence`, `gre_sequence`, `empty_sequence`,
`arbitrary_gradient_sequence`).

**How:** For each sequence, the test calls both `gradient_limits` and the oracle's, with no
window and with a window from 0 to half the total duration, and compares every field (`reason`,
`range_s`, each axis's peak, slew and RMS, and the vector peak), within a tolerance derived
from the sequence (`_rounding_tol`): `1e-12 + 4 * eps * duration / shortest segment`, relative
to the value or to the limit of the same kind. It checks only whether a block is credited, not
which one, because `gre_sequence` repeats its readout, phase-encode and spoiler events every TR,
and the oracle's own choice among such a tie can depend on the same rounding.

**Assumptions:**

- The user chose this tolerance on 2026-09-28. The oracle adds each block's absolute start
  time to an event's corner points before it takes a slope, so each corner time is rounded to
  about eps times the start time, and a slope divides the difference of two such times by the
  segment's duration. The new code computes each event one time from its own offsets. On the
  synthetic and random sequences the differences are at most about 2% of this bound.

#### `test_matches_oracle_on_random_gradient_sequences`

**Checks:** 200 random sequences of trapezoids, extended trapezoids and arbitrary gradients on
random axes, each event built so that it starts and ends at 0 (so every block junction step is
0, and the result is only the per-event, non-junction part that the tests above cover on their
own): `gradient_limits` matches the oracle, on the whole file and on a random window, and the
window's `whole_rms_mt_per_m` (computed in the same call, for the card's "RMS over whole file"
column) matches the oracle's own whole-file RMS.

**How:** For each of 200 seeds, the test builds a sequence of 2 to 6 blocks, each with 0 to 3
random axes, each a trapezoid, an extended trapezoid or an arbitrary gradient built with
pypulseq's `make_*` functions (so pypulseq's own limit checks apply) and an explicit `first` and
`last` of 0 where the function does not default to that. It compares the whole-file result and
a random window's result with the oracle's, field by field, with the same derived tolerance and
the same block-attribution exception as `test_matches_oracle_on_synthetic_sequences`, and separately
compares `whole_rms_mt_per_m` against a fresh whole-file oracle call.

**Assumptions:**

- `make_arbitrary_grad`'s `first` and `last` default to a linear extrapolation of the
  waveform's own edge samples, not to 0 (`docs/notes/slew-definitions.md`'s pypulseq source
  reading confirms this), so the random arbitrary-gradient builder passes `first=0.0, last=0.0`
  explicitly to keep every event zero-ended. This is a fact about pypulseq, not about the
  function under test, and is not itself checked here.

### 2.7 PNS prediction (`test_pns.py`)

`test_pns.py` tests `pns.py`. `PnsPrediction` is now summary-only (`reason`,
`hardware`, `asc_file`, `peak`, `peak_time_s`, `axis_peaks`; no `t_s`,
`norm` or `axes`), built by `pns_prediction` from `pns_levels_for(seq,
gradient_asc=...)` — the SAFE model itself (`pns_levels.pns_levels`, the pinned
pypulseq fork's chunked SAFE recursion) has moved there. `pns_levels_for`
keeps one `PnsLevels` for each (sequence object, hardware), the hardware
being the example hardware, the resolved path of the gradient `.asc`
file, or a `hardware` pair `(struct, label)` (its key is the label and the 27
values of the struct, so two pairs with the same label and values are one
hardware), and the rule of `seq_index.sequence_index` for staleness (all are
rebuilt when the number of blocks or the last block id changes), so that a page with both the PNS summary card and the
diagram's PNS lane for one sequence runs the SAFE model once.
`peak_tr_window` is the start and end of the TR that holds the
prediction's peak, counted from the sequence start in steps of the TR
definition. Without a gradient `.asc` file, the prediction uses pypulseq's
example hardware, which is not a real scanner. The tests of `hardware` are the last
ones of this section.

The real `.asc` files are confidential, so the tests write a test `.asc` file
with the PNS parameters of pypulseq's example hardware, with the
`write_gradient_asc` fixture of `tests/conftest.py`. The stimulation limits
and thresholds in it can be multiplied by a scale factor. The test file can
also have the layout of a scanner file: a main file with an `ASCCONV` block,
CRLF line ends and the name in `asCOMP[0].tName`, which includes a
`_GSWD_SAFETY.asc` file with the PNS parameters under `GradPatSup.Phys.PNS`.

Most of the tests use the synthetic spin echo sequence
(`tests/synthetic.py`'s `spin_echo_sequence`). The `peak_tr_window` tests use
a three-TR sequence built in this file (`_three_trs`): three 50 ms TRs, each a
y trapezoid on the synthetic system and a delay, with a TR definition of
50 ms. One of the three TRs (the "peak TR") has a 0.1 ms rise and fall time,
against 0.4 ms for the others, so its faster slew rate gives it the highest
PNS.

**Assumptions for the whole file:**

- pypulseq's SAFE model is correct. No test compares it with a published
  result or with a scanner.
- No test uses the parameters of a real scanner. A PNS value for the
  synthetic sequences on the scanner is not tested.
- A faster slew rate gives a higher PNS prediction. The SAFE model is driven
  by the slew rate, so this is expected but not calculated in the tests.

#### `test_example_hardware_for_spin_echo`

**Checks:** For the synthetic spin echo sequence on the example hardware, the summary
equals `pns_levels.pns_levels` of the same sequence and hardware, is below the
stimulation limit, and is highest on y.

**How:** The test runs the prediction without an `.asc` file (the module-scoped
`example` fixture) and, separately, `pns_levels.pns_levels` on the same sequence
object. It checks that there is no reason, that the hardware is the example hardware,
and that there is no `.asc` file name. It checks that the axis peaks are keyed x, y and
z, and that the peak is more than 0 and less than 1 (100 % of the limit). The axis with
the highest peak must be y, where the crushers are. `peak`, `peak_time_s` and
`axis_peaks` must equal `pns_levels`'s own fields exactly.

**Assumptions:**

- "Below the limit" is for the example hardware only.
- The crushers (on y) give the synthetic sequence's highest per-axis PNS. This was
  checked against a direct run of the prediction, not derived by hand.
- `pns_prediction` and a fresh `pns_levels.pns_levels` call on the same sequence and
  hardware give bit-identical numbers (no randomness in the pipeline), so the
  comparison is exact equality, not a tolerance.

#### `test_asc_file_with_the_example_parameters`

**Checks:** An `.asc` file with the example hardware's parameters gives the same
prediction as the example hardware, and the file's hardware name and file name.

**How:** The test writes a test `.asc` file with scale factor 1 and runs the
prediction with it. There must be no reason, the hardware name must be the name in the
file, and the file name must be the name of the file. `peak`, `peak_time_s` and each
axis of `axis_peaks` must equal the example hardware's own summary within a relative
10⁻⁹.

**Assumptions:**

- The test file has only the fields that pypulseq's `.asc` reader needs for PNS. A
  real file has many more fields, in the same format.

#### `test_asc_file_that_includes_the_pns_parameters`

**Checks:** A main `.asc` file that includes the PNS parameters from a second file
with `$INCLUDE` gives the same prediction as the example hardware, and the hardware
name in `asCOMP[0].tName`.

**How:** The test writes a test `.asc` file with the scanner layout and scale factor
1, and runs the prediction with the main file. There must be no reason, the hardware
name must be the name in the main file, and the file name must be the name of the main
file. `peak`, `peak_time_s` and each axis of `axis_peaks` must equal the example
hardware's own summary within a relative 10⁻⁹.

**Assumptions:**

- The layout is the layout of the `MP_GradSys_K2309_2250V_951A_XR_AS82.asc` files from
  the XA60 IDEA installation: the `$INCLUDE` line names a file in the same directory,
  without quotes. Other software versions are not tested.

#### `test_asc_file_with_a_missing_include`

**Checks:** When a file that `$INCLUDE` names is not there, reading the `.asc`
file stops with an error that names both files.

**How:** The test writes a test `.asc` file with the scanner layout, deletes
the `_GSWD_SAFETY.asc` file, and reads the main file. It must raise
`FileNotFoundError` with a message that has the main file name and the
included file name.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_included_fields_replace_fields_with_the_same_name`

**Checks:** The fields of an included file are merged into the fields of the
main file, and a field in both files gets the value of the included file.

**How:** The test writes a main file with `a.b[0] = 1`, `a.b[1] = 2`,
`c = "old"` and a `$INCLUDE` line, and an included file with `a.b[1] = 3` and
`c = "new"`. The fields read must be `a.b[0] = 1`, `a.b[1] = 3` and
`c = "new"`.

**Assumptions:**

- In the real files, the `$INCLUDE` line is the last field of the main file,
  so the included values are the last values, as in the file order. A field
  after a `$INCLUDE` line that is also in the included file is not tested.

#### `test_hardware_name`

**Checks:** The hardware name comes from `asCOMP[0].tName` (a scanner file) or
`asCOMP.tName`, and is "unknown" without either.

**How:** The test gives the name function the fields for each of the three
cases and checks the name.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_prediction_scales_with_the_stimulation_limit`

**Checks:** A stimulation limit 10 times lower gives a prediction 10 times
higher, above the limit.

**How:** The test writes a test `.asc` file with scale factor 0.1 and runs the
prediction. The peak must be 10 times the example hardware peak within a
relative 10⁻⁹, and more than 1.

**Assumptions:**

- In the SAFE model, the prediction is inversely proportional to the
  stimulation limit.

#### `test_no_gradients`

**Checks:** A sequence without gradients has no prediction, with the reason
"no gradients", a peak of 0 and no peak time.

**How:** The test makes the synthetic sequence with only a delay block
(`tests/synthetic.py`'s `empty_sequence`) and checks the reason, the hardware
name, the peak and the peak time.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_no_gradients_with_rf_and_adc`

**Checks:** A sequence with RF and ADC events but no gradient events has no
prediction, with the reason "no gradients".

**How:** The test makes a sequence with a block pulse block and an ADC block,
and checks the reason.

**Assumptions:**

- `pns.py` finds "no gradients" from the gradient columns of
  `seq.block_events`. This test and `test_no_gradients` check that other
  events do not count as gradients.

#### `test_a_gradient_on_one_axis_has_a_prediction`

**Checks:** A sequence with a gradient on one axis only, x, y or z, has a
prediction.

**How:** For each axis, the test makes a sequence with a delay block and a
trapezoid block on that axis. There must be no reason, and the peak must be
more than 0.

**Assumptions:**

- A gradient in a block after the first block counts. The delay block comes
  first, so a check of the first block only would fail.

#### `test_prediction_does_not_build_the_gradients_for_an_on_raster_sequence`

**Checks:** The prediction never calls `seq.get_gradients()` for an on-raster sequence.

**How:** The test replaces `get_gradients` of a synthetic spin echo sequence with a
wrapper that counts the calls, and runs the prediction. There must be no calls.

**Assumptions:**

- `pns_levels.pns_levels` samples an on-raster sequence with
  `GradientSampler.block_samples`, not `seq.get_gradients()`/`seq.calculate_pns` (that
  was the old, now-removed, implementation, which is why the old test expected exactly
  one call). `test_pns_levels.py` and `test_sampling.py` test `block_samples` and its
  agreement with `sample`/`get_gradients()` directly; this test only checks that the
  fast path is actually taken from `pns_prediction`.

#### `test_prediction_keeps_no_blocks_and_gives_back_the_cache_setting`

**Checks:** The prediction does not fill pypulseq's block cache, and the
cache setting of the sequence is the same after the prediction.

**How:** For `use_block_cache` True and False, the test sets it on a
synthetic spin echo sequence, empties `seq.block_cache`, and runs the
prediction. After it, `use_block_cache` must have the same value and
`seq.block_cache` must be empty.

**Assumptions:**

- `calculate_pns` reads every block with `get_block`, which keeps each block
  in `seq.block_cache` when `use_block_cache` is True. An empty cache after
  the prediction shows that the cache was off while it ran.

#### `test_prediction_propagates_an_error_and_keeps_the_cache_setting`

**Checks:** An error deep inside the SAFE model propagates out of `pns_prediction`, and
the sequence's block-cache setting and contents are unaffected.

**How:** The test sets `use_block_cache` to True on a synthetic spin echo sequence and
replaces `pns_levels._safe_gwf_to_pns_chunk` (the pinned fork's chunk function) with a
function that raises `RuntimeError`. The prediction must raise the error,
`use_block_cache` must be True and `seq.block_cache` must be empty afterward.

**Assumptions:**

- The block cache is touched only inside `seq_index.block_cache_off`'s own
  `try`/`finally`, which has already restored `use_block_cache` by the time the chunk
  function runs (`GradientSampler` is built, with the block cache off, before the
  chunk loop starts). So this test checks that the error propagates and that nothing
  else in `pns_levels_for`/`pns_prediction` touches the cache setting outside that
  narrower guarantee, not that the guarantee itself is new.

#### `test_peak_tr_window_finds_the_tr_with_the_peak`

**Checks:** For each position of the peak TR (first, second or third) in the
three-TR sequence, `peak_tr_window` returns that whole TR, and the
prediction's peak time is inside it.

**How:** For peak TR k = 0, 1 and 2, the test builds `_three_trs(k)`, runs the
prediction, and calls `peak_tr_window` with the peak time. The window must be
50k s to 50(k + 1) ms (converted to seconds), and the peak time must be
inside it.

**Assumptions:**

- TRs are counted from the start of the sequence, in steps of the TR
  definition.

#### `test_peak_tr_window_without_a_tr_definition_is_none`

**Checks:** Without a TR definition, `peak_tr_window` returns None.

**How:** The test builds the three-TR sequence, removes its TR definition,
runs the prediction, and calls `peak_tr_window` with the peak time. The
result must be None.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_peak_tr_window_with_one_tr_is_none`

**Checks:** When the sequence is not longer than one TR, `peak_tr_window`
returns None.

**How:** The test takes the synthetic spin echo sequence, whose duration is
much less than a TR, and sets its TR definition to its own duration exactly.
`peak_tr_window` with any peak time must return None.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_peak_tr_window_without_a_peak_time_is_none`

**Checks:** With no peak time (`None`), `peak_tr_window` returns None.

**How:** The test builds the three-TR sequence and calls `peak_tr_window`
with `peak_time_s=None`. The result must be None.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_keeps_one_result_for_each_asc_file`

**Checks:** `pns_levels_for` keeps one result for each (sequence, gradient `.asc`
file): a different `.asc` file for the same sequence computes once, and going back to
an earlier file does not compute again.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` the same way as the test above, and calls
`pns.pns_levels_for(seq, gradient_asc=path)` for two different `.asc` files (`path_a`,
`path_b`) built by the `write_gradient_asc` fixture of `tests/conftest.py`, in the order a, a, b, a. It
checks the call count is 1, 1 (cached), 2 (a different file), 2 (back to `path_a`,
restored from the kept results).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_alternating_two_hardwares_runs_the_model_two_times`

**Checks:** Two hardwares of one sequence alternated (a, b, a, b) run the SAFE model two
times, not four: the cache keeps one result for each hardware.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` as above, and calls
`pns.pns_levels_for(seq, gradient_asc=...)` with the keys `None` (the example hardware),
a `.asc` file, `None`, the same file. It checks there were 2 calls.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_hardware_from_an_asc_file_gives_the_levels_of_the_file`

**Checks:** `pns_levels_for(seq, hardware=(asc_to_hw(read_gradient_asc(path)), label))`
gives the levels of `pns_levels_for(seq, gradient_asc=path)`, except `hardware` (the
label) and `asc_file` (None), for the plain layout and for the layout of a scanner file.

**How:** Parametrized on `split`. The `write_gradient_asc` fixture of `tests/conftest.py`
writes the file. The test compares each field but the two (`numpy.array_equal` for the
arrays, `==` for the rest).

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_refuses_both_gradient_asc_and_hardware`

**Checks:** `pns_levels_for` with `gradient_asc` and `hardware` together raises
`ValueError`, and does not run the SAFE model.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` as in the tests below, calls
`pns_levels_for` with both inside `pytest.raises(ValueError, match="not both")`, and
checks that the patch recorded no call.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_keeps_one_result_for_equal_hardware_pairs`

**Checks:** Two `hardware` pairs with the same label and the same field values, with two
different struct objects, are one hardware: the second call runs no model and gives the
kept result.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` as above and calls `pns_levels_for(seq,
hardware=(safe_example_hw(), "LABEL"))` two times, each with a new struct. It checks
that there was 1 call and that the second result `is` the first.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_computes_again_for_another_label_or_value`

**Checks:** A `hardware` pair with another label, or with one other field value, runs
the model; going back to an earlier pair does not run it again.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` as above and calls with the pairs a, a, b (the
label "B"), c (`z.stim_thresh` plus 1), a, c, each with a new struct where the values are
the same. It checks the call count after each change: 1, 1, 2, 3, 3.

**Assumptions:** None.

#### `test_pns_levels_for_hardware_pair_is_not_the_example_hardware_or_a_file`

**Checks:** A `hardware` pair has its own key: the example hardware (no argument), a
`.asc` file, and a pair with the values and the label of the example hardware are three
hardwares of one sequence. Each runs the model one time.

**How:** The test patches `pns.pns_levels` as above, and calls the three two times in
the same order. It checks that there were 3 calls.

**Assumptions:** None.
